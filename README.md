# strace

Will have youtube video link here shortly.

This is a simple introduction to Linux's handling of file
handles. In this video and code excercise you can learn
the following:

1. What file handles Linux opens by default on an open process.
2. How Linux handles IO on an unlinked file.
3. How to find the data contents of an unlinked file.
4. How linux assigns file descriptors to a process.
5. What strace shows and how to use strace for debugging.
6. How lsof and strace overlap.
7. How Linux's /proc filesystem works with PIDs and filehandles.
8. The differences between Linux's manual page 2 section for
   file IO and manual page 3 section for file IO, and how #2
   is really all that matters.
9. A brief introduction to separation between Linux's user space
   and kernel space.
10. The abbreviated difference between buffered and unbuffered IO.
11. The relationship between python and C and how to port a C
    application to python.
